## Introduction

This repository presents solutions for two distinct 2D flow scenarios, leveraging the Stream Function and Vorticity Method. These computational solutions were developed as part of the Computational Methods in Thermal and Fluid Engineering course for graduate students at IIT Bombay.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses two specific flow scenarios outlined in the "TPSW-Method.pdf" document. It provides solutions for each problem, utilizing MATLAB as my primary computational tool. These problems are categorized as follows:

1. **Cavity Flow**: Solves the fluid flow within a cavity, with code and results provided as "cavity_files".

2. **Plane T Channel Flow**: Addresses  flow scenarios described in the problem statement, with corresponding code and results provided as "T files."

## Project Overview

While the project represents a foundation for solving these fluid dynamics challenges, it's important to note that due to time constraints, the algorithms may not be fully optimized. Nevertheless, these codes serve as valuable starting points for anyone interested in expanding, improving, or exploring alternative approaches to fluid flow simulations.

## Purpose and Contribution

The primary objectives of this repository are to provide:

- Accessible solutions to specific fluid flow problems.
- A starting point for further exploration and optimization.
- A platform for collaboration and contributions from the community.
