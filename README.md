# Fluid_Flow-2D
Stream Function and Vorticity method based solution of 2D in-compressible flow

## Problem Statement:
There are 2 types of 2D flows given. Go through the problem statement given in the TPSW-Method.pdf <br>
The solution consists of cavity_files which are on the first problem and the T files for the latter.<br>
This was done as part of the Computational Methods in Thermal and Fluid Engineering course for Grad students at IIT Bombay <br>
Both problems were solved using MATLAB. <br>
Due to severe time constraints juggling with a lot of courses, there could definitely be better algorithms to solve these. However, these codes could be a starting point for others to build upon.
